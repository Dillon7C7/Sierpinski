# Sierpi≈Ñski Squares
This is just a little exercise I did in Python to practice recursion with multiple calls. This program initially draws a square, and then recursively draws a square in the upper-left, upper-right, and lower-right quadrants a fixed number of times. Typically this exercise is done with equilateral triangles, but I opted for squares.
